udup
====

A simple script to find file duplicates in a directory.


About
-----

First of all, should you use it? The answer is: probably not.  Read
on if you want to know what it's for.

The name *udup* is short for "un-duplicate", and it is named like that
because the term "deduplication" is generally associated with file
systems these days.

It creates MD5-hashes of the files in a directory and identifies
duplicates regardless of their names, whose paths are then printed to
the console.

Right now, it's just a little side project to get my hands dirty on
some APIs and to get started with *GitHub*.  And while it's working
code, I'm sure there a lot of other projects that have solved the same 
problem already, and in a much better way.  Therefore, it's probably
only useful if you're interested in how it works or if want to use
(parts of) the code yourself.

Note: if your goal is to compare two directories with identically-named
files, you may want to have a look at the Python standard library's
``filecmp`` module instead.


Requirements
------------

Python 3.5; it may work with older versions, but that's untested.


Usage
-----

Run the Ant ``build.xml`` to create a *zippapp*, or run ``main.py``
directly.  You probably have to adjust the path to your Python 3.5
executable in ``build.xml`` before running it for the first time.  The
program takes one argument, the directory in which to search for 
duplicates. Windows::

   > python udup.pyz "path\to\directory_with_duplicate_files"
   
     - or -
   
   > python main.py "path\to\directory_with_duplicate_files"
   
Linux::

   $ python3.5 udup.pyz "path/to/directory_with_duplicate_files"
   
     - or -
   
   $ chmod +x main.py
   $ ./main.py "path/to/directory_with_duplicate_files"
   
* Search the directory and its sub-folders recursively with ``-R``.
